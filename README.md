## Background

### Problem Statement:

This document is a report from the final course project for the
**Inferential Statistics course**, as part of the **Duke University
Statistics with R course in partnership with Coursera**.

The project consisted of exploring a real-world dataset (a subset of the
**General Social Survey**) in order to create a report that included
statistical inference on a question of interest (ended up using three
questions).

### Summary:

-   Although small, there were significant differences between
    **genders** on whether **sexual education should be taught in
    schools**. This is especially important for single parents, or
    parents of the same sex, where one’s stance and actions cannot
    overcompensate for the other’s
-   We could not prove significant differences in the representation of
    each **gender** amongst the various **social classes**
-   There were significant differences in **total family income** based
    on the **respondent’s family income when 16 years old**. This is
    important as the earned income should be independent of someone’s
    family background. Further measures should be put into place for
    helping out those in unfavourable groups

*Note: all of the research questions are focusing on the survey data in
the year 2012 to account for year-on-year variances and display the most
recent view that our data could provide.*

### Next steps/recommendations:

-   analyse changes between years (ie. 1980 vs 2012)
-   some variables (ie. social class) were subjective and registered
    based on the respondent’s opinion (more objective methods should be
    considered)
-   further expand on the analysis by looking at other related factors
    (ie. if there was a difference between total family income based on
    the respondent’s family income when 16 years old, can we find any
    further variables that can provide a more in-depth view as to why?)

### Dataset

Since 1972, the General Social Survey (GSS) has been monitoring societal
change and studying the growing complexity of American society. The GSS
aims to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor
and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and
attributes; to examine the structure and functioning of society in
general as well as the role played by relevant subgroups; to compare the
United States to other societies in order to place American society in
comparative perspective and develop cross-national models of human
society; and to make high-quality data easily accessible to scholars,
students, policy makers, and others, with minimal cost and waiting.
